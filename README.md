# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._
## Difference from original repo:
- add [doit](https://pydoit.org/) support (use Makefile-like CLI even on Windows)
- add loguru support
- add [DVC](https://dvc.org/) and [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) requirement (allows reproducible and trackable experiments run)
- add pylint, flake8 and bandit support
- add pytest config file


#### [Original project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------
